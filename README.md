This application was made with help from Bob Ziroll's React course on Scrimba 
The application uses Vite to run locally

Firebase's Firestore is used for persistence and a config (firebase.js) is 
needed to to make the app run

Quick start:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````

Head over to https://vitejs.dev/ to learn more about using vite
