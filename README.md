This application was made with help from Bob Ziroll's React course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)

The application uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to run locally

[Firebase's](https://firebase.google.com/) Firestore is used for persistence and a config (firebase.js) is 
needed to to make the app run

Quick start:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````
